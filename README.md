**This game is the classic javascript crystal game with a slight twist! 

**This game showcases my ability to use javascript as well as JQuery. 

**The game works by an intiation functin being called that generates a random target score between 20 and 120, setting your score to zero, **and a random value being assigned to each button. 


**As you click each button a score is totaled, and if your score equals the target number you win! 


**After each win and loss, the intiation function is recalled and the game starts over!
